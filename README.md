## About Data Set
This  dataset  is  originally  from  the  National  Institute  of  Diabetes  and  Digestive  and  Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whethera patient has diabetes, based  on  certain  diagnostic  measurements  included  in  the dataset.  Several  constraints  were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Note:You do not needto download the data. Two subsetsof data for training and test is created and  posted  for  downloading.The  original  data  set  also  is  included  for  your  further  testing  and experimenting.<br>
